# stat302-chicago-airbnb-project

Yoshi D'Souza and Macy Bosnich's final project exploring AirBnB data for the city of Chicago. 

In this GitHub, we have included a link to our original and cleaned data set. There are also three R files which each correspond to a part of our project. 
Data cleaning is an R file containing all the code we used to manipulate, clean, and join the data together for analysis.
Map.R is an intermediary file which includes just the Shiny app for the map within it
Map_Update.R is our final project output with all the relevant graphs and maps included in one cohesive app. It also includes our explanations and write-ups. 

Thanks for an awesome quarter! We've loved your class!!
